    --- \(\Delta q^d\) (Quantity demand)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Only caused by an own price Change
        \item Movement along the demand curve
    \end{itemize}

    --- \(\Delta D\) (Demand)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Caused by a change in a non-(own)-price determinant of demand (D 
        shifters)
        \item Shift of the \emph{entire} demand curve
    \end{itemize}

    --- D Shifters
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increase in the number of buyers
        \item Income
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A \emph{normal good} is positively related to income. An 
            increase in income causes an increase in \(q^d\) at each point, 
            shifting the \(D\) curve to the right.
            \item An \emph{inferior good} is negatively related to income. An
            increase in income shifts \(D\) curves for inferior goods to the 
            left.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Prices of related goods
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Substitutes

            Let \(x, y\) be substitutes, then:
            \[\downarrow p_x \xrightarrow{\uparrow q_x^d} \downarrow D_y\]
            \[\uparrow p_x \xrightarrow{\downarrow q_x^d} \uparrow D_y\]

            \item Complements

            Let \(u, v\) be complements, then:
            \[\uparrow p_u \xrightarrow{\downarrow q_u^d}\downarrow D_v\]
            \[\downarrow p_u \xrightarrow{\uparrow q_u^d}\uparrow D_v\]
        \end{itemize}
        \item Tastes/Preferences
        \item Expectations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item about future prices
            \item about future income
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
