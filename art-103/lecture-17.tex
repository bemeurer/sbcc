    \newpage
        (7 -- 55) Here we see the beginning of the move away from naturalism and a bigger focus on the representativeness of the reliefs, given them a mainly informational role.

        (7 -- 56) Here the same thing is seen, a rejection of single-point perspective and a return to the ``stacking'' that was common in the past.

        (7 -- 57) The main idea here is the Emperor on the horseback as an imagery of power. Also the hierarchy of scale is interesting since he's larger than the horse. 

        (7 -- 59) This is an Asiatic sarcophagus. The sculpture on top is of the deceased.

        \subsection{Late Empire}
        \begin{flushright}
            193 -- 337 CE
        \end{flushright}

        (7 -- 63) Again here we see the rejection of classical naturalism and a more abstract approach to the depictions.

        (7 -- 71) The tetrarchy is the rule by four tetrachs.

        (7 -- 73) This is the Arch of Constantine. Constantine was responsible for ending the persecution of Christians. He also became the sole ruler of the Roman empire and established its new capital in Constantinople.
        
        (7 -- 75) Here we see that Constantine returned with the tradition of the always youthful ruler, he was never depicted as old.
        
        (7 -- 76) The huge statue of Constantine was probably placed here in the Basilica Nova.
