    \noindent\textbf{``U.S. productivity experienced rapid growth from 1995 to 2010, but it has slowed recently.''}

    Usually any given slowing in Economic metrics will cause some degree of panic and worry, and yet it seems to be to be completely expected, given the law of diminishing returns. Should we worry about lowering productivity \emph{growth}, or is it perfectly natural, and expected?
