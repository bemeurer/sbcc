    \noindent\textbf{``The Neural Net That Recreated ‘Blade Runner’ Has the Movie Stuck in Its Memory''}

    Neural Networks (NN) operate by ``learning'' patterns, representing them in a linear algebra scheme, and then processing input through that scheme. With this in mind, how is it surprising, or interesting, that a NN manages to transfer style? The research used for it, which is the use of convolutional-type NN's for style transfer is rather old as well.
