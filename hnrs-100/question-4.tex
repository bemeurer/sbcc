    \noindent\textbf{``Migrant crisis `a German problem' --- Hungary's Orban''}

    Today's Migrant Crisis, arguably the greatest threat to Europen stability since Hitler, has mostly been caused by the civil war taking place in Syria, as well as other minor conflicts in the Middle East.
    Given that all said conflicts have in common Russian interference, and that it is trivially true that Russia has a direct interest in European instability, is it reasonable to assume that the crisis is premediated, and has the exact objective of causing the observed instability?
