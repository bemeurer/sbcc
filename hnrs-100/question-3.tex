    \noindent\textbf{``How America Lost Its Mind''}

    Perhaps a good analysis to be made here is to look at the problem from a Lacanian perspective.
    In his seminars Lacan shows us that our view of others, which is to say the little other in Lacanian terms, is directly bound to the Ego; for lacan the little other is a collection of our alter-egos that represent our perception of others, and is contained within the Imaginary register of the Borromean Knot.
    With this in mind, can we claim that our lack of understanding, or acceptance, of people is due to the fact that we lack even the most basic knowledge of their warrants in order to construct a minimally accurate alter-ego from our perceptions?
