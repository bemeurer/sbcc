    Yet again here we see Sherman Alexie's painful shortcomings as an author. In ``Do Not Go Gentle'' he, much like in the other stories of ``Ten Little Indians'', writes as if he were an \emph{edgy} teenager who, at every possible chance, brings supposedly taboo motifs into his stories to shock the audience. We no longer live in the 1930's, a dildo doesn't shock anyone who has been on the internet for a couple hours and, because of this, the whole story seems just plainly ridiculous, not in the sense of being funny as intended by the author, but rather in the sense that the fact that someone would bother to publish it is itself ridiculous. Reading through the story the only feeling I had was contempt for the people who find this to be ``great writing,'' it feels like something a senior in high-school with below-average writing skills would produce. To think that anyone finds this worthy of publishing at all is a stark reminder of just how low literature standards have fallen in today's post-modernist world.
