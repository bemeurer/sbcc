    ``Social institutions sometimes do their work simply by denying people access to information, but principally by directing how much weight and, therefore, value one must give to information.'' (Postman 73)

    Is it not the raison d'Ãªtre of the Internet at large exactly, consciously, and willingly to end this biased control of information? Is it not what we seek as a society to free information from the shackles cast on upon it by those who ``know better'' and are apt to feed it in a healthy manner to the population?
