    \section{Meditation IV}
        Judging is the combination of (finite) intellect and (infinite) will. Descartes argues that the Will, or Free Will, is the most perfect of out powers (faculties).

        Descartes calls ``indifference'' the lowest grade of liberty, when your intellect doesn't give you enough evidence to make true judgement. He argues that when your will is impelled/compelled to affirm what the intellect is providing.

    \section{Meditation V}
    --- \emph{Of the essence of material things, and once more of God and that 
    he exists}
    
    The essence of materia/physical things (bodies). It's extended -- so it's divisible, has parts, size, figure, location, motion, and to this motion duration. ``Every triangle I imagine will share some properties, and necessarily so, otherwise they wouldn't be triangles. They all have three sides. This is true for all shapes. Think of the Chilleagon, you cannot even imagine it, but you know the nature of it''

    Descartes second argument for God's existence mirrors St. Anselm's ontological argument.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item I have an idea of God
        \item This idea is of the most perfect being, ``God is the most objectively real being''
        \item If something lacks existence it lacks a perfection.
        \item Therefore God doesn't lack existence
    \end{enumerate}
