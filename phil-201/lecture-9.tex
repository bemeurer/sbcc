    Descartes argument for a ``real distinction'' between mind \& body:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item I know that clean \& distinct perception can be trusted.
        
        \item So, for instance, the fact that I clearly and distinctly understand that one substance apart from another is enough to make certain that the two substances are really distinct, since they are capable of being separated, at least by God.
        
        \item I have a clear \& distinct understanding of my self (I am simply a thinking, non-extended substance).

        \item I have a clear \& distinct understanding of body (it is simply an extended, nonthinking substance)

        \item \textbf{Therefore}, It is certain that I am really distinct from my body (any body) and can exist without it.
    \end{enumerate}
