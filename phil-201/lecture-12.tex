        \section*{Anne Conway}
        \begin{flushright}
            1631 -- 1679\\
            England
        \end{flushright}
        Anne's main tutor was Henry More, who was a Cambridge Platonist. Moreover, Conway was also influenced by \emph{Kabbalah}, which is Jewish mysticism. She also became a Quaker. She had cronic migraines, which as far as we know was the cause of her pain, and Quakerism helped her with the pain. 

        She was definitely motivated by religious concerns. She was philosophically and theologically \emph{ecumenical}.

        ``Every created being is both body (this is the passive aspect) and has spirit -- immaterial (this is the active aspect)''

        ``Every created being has the same essence: changeable in therms of becoming more or less spiritual (active)''
